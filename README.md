# DevelopingDataProducts
This is my course assignment for Developing Data Products.  It is a study of ACA Health Insurance in Florida.

All the data for this assignment came from the cms.gov website.
They publish Public Use Files and the one that interested me was called, 
https://data.healthcare.gov/dataset/2016-QHP-Landscape-Individual-Market-Medical/v7sn-c66v/data
There is a similar site for 2015 and 2014.  

This project took forever (at least 50 hours).  I did the data manipulation in Excel because I never
would have completed it in R.  Once I had the dataset though "20141516.csv" I did everything from that point
on in R.  

I really struggled to get the datatable to
be reactive to the inputs.  I would love to have been able to add a Select All and a De-Select All
to the Counties but I gave up and figured I had done enought to pass the project.  What I have done
is reactive.  

If I was better at R I would love to have flattened the file so people could drill down on the
pricing by age as well.  Currently Age is a column and not a row per plan type.

I'm sure you R wizards could have done something more amazing.  I learned a lot and I think I fulfilled
the items needed for the project.
